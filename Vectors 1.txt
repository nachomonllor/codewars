##Let's make this short!
Remember, this is a kata which focuses on object oriented programming
• Task: Create a class Vector3D
• Properties: X, Y, Z and Length as double and public scope and accessors
• X, Y and Z will be set by test methods
• Length should only have an get-accessor which calculates the vector's length
##Some references, to get into the topic
The length or magnitude or norm of the vector a is denoted by ‖a‖ or, less commonly, |a|, which is not to be confused with the absolute value (a scalar "norm").
The length of the vector a can be computed with the Euclidean norm

##Tests
Final tests include 2 fixed and 125 random tests. They will look like this:
double length = new Vector3D()
{
  X = 0,
  Y = 0,
  Z = 2
}.Length;
length == 2 // true
##PostScriptum
If this kata gets enough reputation, I will add some follow up katas!

using System;

public class Vector3D
{
    public double X { get; set; }
    public double Y { get; set; }
    public double Z { get; set; }
    
    public double Length 
    { 
        get
        {
            double length = Math.Pow(X, 2) + Math.Pow(Y, 2) + Math.Pow(Z, 2);
            length = Math.Sqrt(length);
            return length;
        } 
    }
}
